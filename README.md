[12] Develop a drag-and-drop GUI for deep learning experimentation : https://github.com/NISYSLAB/Emory-BMI-GSoC/blob/main/README.md

The aim of this project is to create a GUI that enables users to run Deep Learning experiments visually via drag&drop, so that they would not need to code  these architectures/networks themselves.
